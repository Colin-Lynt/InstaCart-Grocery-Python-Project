# InstaCart-Grocery-Python-Project

## About
Instacart is a fictional online grocery company that has hired me as a data analyst. My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria utilizing python. They want me to look into customer purchasing habits and identify common trends to start a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.
